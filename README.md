# Ex.1 Cloud Account Setup and Services Overview in Microsoft Azure

# Aim:
To create a cloud account in Microsoft Azure and to explore its services such as Compute, IoT, and Security.

# Procedure:
## Step 1: Go to the Azure Website
•	Visit https://azure.microsoft.com

•	Click on “Start free” or “Free account” in the top right corner.
## Step 2: Sign Up with Microsoft Account

## Step 7: Sign In to Azure Portal
•	Go to https://portal.azure.com

•	Sign in with your Microsoft account.

## Create a User with Administrative Access (Azure Active Directory):
## Secure your Azure account root user
•	Sign in to the Azure Portal as the account owner.

## Services Overview in Azure:
Azure provides 200+ cloud services. In this experiment, we focus on the following key categories:
## 1.	Compute Services
•	Azure Virtual Machines (VMs): On-demand Windows/Linux servers.

•	Azure App Services: Hosting web applications without managing infrastructure.

•	Azure Functions: Serverless compute that runs event-driven code.

## 2.	IoT Services
•	Azure IoT Hub: Central messaging hub for secure communication between IoT applications and devices.

•	Azure IoT Central: Simplified IoT app platform for rapid deployment.

•	Azure Digital Twins: Model real-world environments digitally.
## 3.	Security Services
 •	Microsoft Defender for Cloud: Protects cloud resources from threats.

•	Key Vault: Securely stores and manages secrets, keys, and certificates.

•	Sentinel: Cloud-native SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solution.
